Practice problems data science
The purpose of this repository is to store some notebooks while I was training myself in datascience techniques that can be used for future reference.

# ISLR - Introduction to Statistical Learning
[Introduction to Statistical Learning - Book](https://www.statlearning.com/) available completely free with lots of practice problems and labs is a very good book for getting started with machine learning/datascience methods. While the code within the book is in R, I decided to do the majority of my work in Python because I was more comfortable with that language.

# Kaggle
[Kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com) has also been a great resource after I moved on from the textbook stuff since it has some great teaching content as well as competitions (even some beginner friendly ones) and datasets that can be used to apply the techniques.

# Environment setup

While Kaggle does provide a very nice notebook environment that users can get up to speed right away on, for most things I prefer to work on my own machine. I intend to include information and files/scripts that could be used to set up a datascience environment.
